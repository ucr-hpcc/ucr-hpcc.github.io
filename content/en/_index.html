  <h3>HPCC Operation During COVID-19 Crisis </h3>
  <p>Since the research computing infrastructure of the HPCC is designed to be
  accessed remotely, we are currently not expecting any major downtimes or
  restrictions for users due to the campus access restrictions caused by the
  COVID-19 pandemic.

  <h3>Mission and Services</h3>
  <p>The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) provides state-of-the-art research
  computing infrastructure and training accessible to all UCR researchers and affiliates
  at low cost. This includes access to the shared HPC resources and services summarized below.</p>
  <p>The main advantage of a shared research computing environment is access to a much larger HPC
  infrastructure (with thousands of CPUs/GPUs and many PBs of directly attached
  storage) than what smaller clusters of individual research groups could afford,
  while also providing a long-term sustainability plan and professional systems
  administrative support.</p>
