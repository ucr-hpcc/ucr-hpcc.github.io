## Overview

The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) provides state-of-the-art research computing
infrastructure and training accessible to all UCR researchers and affiliates at low cost. This
includes access to shared HPC resources and services. Currently, the HPCC has over 
150 active research gropus with more than 800 users. Its resources are also heavily used 
for instructing undergraduate and graduate classes in a wide range of computational, 
statistical, life science and engineering disciplines.
