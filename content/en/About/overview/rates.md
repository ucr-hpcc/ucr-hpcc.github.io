## Purchased Disk Information

To achieve our desired balance of performance and density in our storage systems
we must place some restrictions on the lifetime of purchased storage. Details can
be found in our [Owned Storage Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Up48pPWidYAN0wHsFiiqGQ676C-lPKinqBV_kXKSF0k/edit)

## Ownership Models

For more information relating to owned storage, see the [Ownership models](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/about/overview/access/#ownership-models) section of the Access page.

## External user accounts
Accounts for external customers can only be granted if a lab has a strong
affiliation with UC Riverside, such as a research collaboration with UCR
researchers. Both the corresponding UCR PI and external collaborator need to
maintain an HPCC subscription. External accounts are subject to an annual
review and approval process. To be approved, the external and internal PIs have
to complete this [External Usage Justification](https://bit.ly/32O1lC9).
