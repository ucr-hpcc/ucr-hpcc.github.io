## External user accounts
Accounts for external customers can only be granted if a lab has a strong
affiliation with UC Riverside, such as a research collaboration with UCR
researchers. Both the corresponding UCR PI and external collaborator need to
maintain an HPCC subscription. External accounts are subject to an annual
review and approval process. To be approved, the external and internal PIs have
to complete this [External Usage Justification](https://bit.ly/32O1lC9).
