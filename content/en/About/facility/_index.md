## Mission

The High-Performance Computing Center (HPCC) provides state-of-the-art research computing
infrastructure and training accessible to all UCR researchers and affiliates at low cost. This
includes access to the shared HPC resources and services. The main advantage of a shared
research computing environment is access to a much larger HPC infrastructure (with thousands
of CPUs/GPUs and many PBs of directly attached storage) than what smaller clusters of
individual research groups could afford, while also providing a long-term sustainability plan and
professional systems administrative support.
