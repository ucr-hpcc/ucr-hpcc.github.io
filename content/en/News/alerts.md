## Unscheduled exceptions and downtimes

None observed at this time.


## Scheduled exceptions and downtimes

__12-August-2025 (Updated Aug 7)__

Begins: Tuesday, August 12, 9pm
Ends: Thursday, August 14, evening

The upcoming HPCC maintenance shutdown once again has been shifted due to another schedule change by the electrical
contractors.

The HPCC apologizes for the uncertainty and disruptions caused by these sudden developments. These maintenance events are
necessary for the long-term health of the cluster and related systems. Thanks for your continued support and understanding.

Update Aug 14: Maintenance is unfortunately behind schedule. At this time, headnodes are
available for data access and light work. Compute nodes will come up over the
next 24 hours. Apologies for the delays.


__Early September__

There will be a follow-up power shutdown in the SOMED-1 Data Center, tentatively scheduled for early September.
We will send out alert emails as more details are confirmed.

## Past exceptions

__18-June-2025__

* __2:45 PM__: Power is restored and ssh into our head nodes is working again. More detailed information to follow...

* __12:45 PM__: Serveral buidlings on campus including SOMED1 (where HPCC server room is located) lost electrical power. Updates will be posted here and/or on Slack. 

* __3:00 PM__: All HPCC Services should be available again. Please reach out to support if you find anything misbehaiving, and stay up to date with the remaining ITS outages on the [TechAlerts](https://techalerts.ucr.edu/) page.


__14-May-2025__

* __1:00 AM__: There was a power outage affecting several buildings on campus, including our server room in SOMED1 at approximately 1AM. Until the larger 500kW UPS will be installed in late
summer, not all of our computing nodes are battery backed up. However, our core infrastructure is UPS backed up, including storage, administration nodes, etc. 
Our newer "epyc" and modern GPU nodes (`gpu[06-09]`) are also battery backed up and should not have lost any jobs. Nodes in the "intel", "batch", and "highmem" partitions, and 
nodes gpu[01-05], are not on battery backup at the moment, so any jobs running on them at the time of the outage were lost and will need to be resubmitted. We're sorry for this disruption, 
and we're working on bringing the remaining nodes back online.

* __9:00 AM__: Most or all machines and services should be operational again. Jobs that were impacted should be requeued automatically.


__17-Mar-2025__

* 8:00 AM: We are still working on the getting the internal network configured in the new server room.
We are optimistic to finalize the configuration later today. Sorry again for these delays.
* 4:30 PM: __Headnodes are available for user login again!!!__ We're now working on bringing up some compute nodes.
It's unlikely that all compute resources will come online by tonight.
* 8:00 PM: A significant portion of compute and GPU nodes have been brought online. The remaining nodes will
follow when we've properly assessed power/network load balancing and server room cooling capacity. OnDemand
should be functional. Other secondary services like JupyterHub and license servers will come online tomorrow.

__15-Mar-2025__

The cluster shutdown is unfortunately running behind schedule, due to unexpected delays in the moving process.
We apologize for the extended shutdown, and the negative impact this will have on your research.

* 1:30 AM: Core HPCC infrastructure booted successfully.
* 10:00 AM: Sysadmins are on site to continue work on restoring cluster functionality.
* 9:00 PM: Sysadmins have concluded their efforts for the weekend. Network difficulties hindered our progress.

__10-Mar-2025 to 14-Mar-2025__

**_Move into New Server Room:_** The HPCC's long-awaited move to a much larger and newly renovated server room
in the SOM-ED1 building is finally happening! This major improvement will
unfortunately require about 5 days of downtime to move all HPCC systems to the
new server room, and redeploy and test them. We apologize for the disruption
this will cause to your research. This is a rare and unique event (once every
20+ years) that requires extensive organization and coordination between
multiple parties and is a major logistical undertaking.

**_Benefits:_** The relocation of the HPCC will result in considerably more rack space, electrical and cooling capacity, and more dependable system operation, allowing us to accommodate substantially more CPU/GPU computing resources and data storage now and in the future. These enhancements will translate to significant benefits for all users.

**_Schedule:_** Starting the morning of March 10th, users' access will be stopped, and we will begin shutting down all running jobs and services (see below). Any computing jobs that will still be running during the shutdown will need to be terminated by us. Users can restart or re-submit them after the move. Most services will be available again in the evening of March 14th.

**_Services Impacted:_** All services hosted by the HPCC will be down during this
period. This includes, but is not limited to cluster access (SSH, Slurm, data
access), including HTTP access to user data; as well as services provided by OnDemand; RStudio/Posit, MATLAB, Jupyter, etc. Please note, email sent to support@hpcc.ucr.edu will also not work (only direct email). During the move,
HPCCâ€™s Slack workspace (https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com) will be the main means of
group communication with users.

**_Notes:_** As we get closer to the shutdown you might see your jobs get queued with the reason "ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance". This will happen when the runtime of your job will overlap with the shutdown. If your job can tolerate a shorter runtime, please adjust it to not overlap. If the job requires a longer runtime, then it will need to wait until after our servers are back online.

__23-Feb-2025: AC Issues__

+ 8:00AM: The condensers on the roof of the Genomics building both lost power, which caused both CRAC units in our server room to stop cooling. Facilities is on site and are working to bring the AC units back online.
+ 9:00AM: Facilities was able to bring one of the condensers back online, and are working on bringing one of the AC units back to alleviate some of the heat. To prevent our power infrastructure from overheating, we've had to kill running jobs on the cluster. We apologize for this inconvenience.
+ 12:00PM: Emergency repairs on the AC system are complete, and load-shedded servers have been brought back online. Thank you for your patience.

__02-Nov-2024: AC Issues__

+ 11:00AM: One of our 2 redundent AC units has began blowing hot air into the server room. While facilities diagnoses and resolves the issue we have paused the Slurm queue. We are sorry for the interruption.
+ 12:00PM: Update: to avoid overheating the power in the HPCC had to be shut down. This affects all HPCC services hosted from the Genomics Server room, including SSH login, Slurm jobs, and e-mail ticket system. We're working on bringing services up safely and quickly.
+ 4:00PM: Currently, the cluster is still down because of a problem with one of the AC units. Physical plant and the systems administrator are working hard to bring everything back online again. As of now, it is hard to tell how long it will take until things are back to normal again. Please be patient and check the alert page here as well as your Slack messages.
+ 5:00AM (Nov 3): Headnodes are available for login. The /rhome and /bigdata storage systems are fully functional, so you may retrieve your files and do some light work. A limited number of compute and GPU nodes may come online depending on sysadmin discretion and cooling constraints. AC repairs will begin on Monday at the earliest, and these repairs must be completed before we can bring the cluster back fully online. Again, we apologize for the disruption.
+ 12:00PM (Nov 3): A small number of nodes from each partition have been made available. We will slowly release more nodes as we monitor the temperature and work on the AC unit continues.
+ 12:00PM (Nov 4): A temporary fix is in place as facilities awaits parts for a complete fix. We are slowly increasing the number of available compute nodes, though with limited job runtimes. Currently any job with a runtime that will end before Nov 10 at Midnight will run. As temperatures in the room hold, we will increase the time limit and number of nodes in operation.
+ 11:00AM (Nov 7): Facilities is in the process of obtaining the equipment necessary for the repairs. We've been told by them that the repair will not require shutting down the AC units, so **we can resume operations as normal. We have removed the existing reservation, so long-running jobs may begin. We will continue to release the remaining offline nodes throughout the day as well.**


__24-Jun-2024: AC Work Completed__
The AC repairs have been completed by facilities. Over the next few hours we will slowly begin to bring nodes back online.

__22-Jun-2024: Update on AC Unit Problems__

UCR Facilities was able to return the affected AC unit to working order. However, the unit is still in suboptimal condition, and will have to be powered off for full maintenance on Monday (Jun 24). Until then, HPCC will have to limit the capacity of the Slurm cluster. This compromise will allow maintenance to be safely performed without resorting to a full emergency cancellation of all jobs.


__21-Jun-2024: Network Outage and HVAC Problem__

Starting 5:15 PM the network connection to the HPCC server room is down. This might be related to a larger network problem on campus, see [here](https://techalerts.ucr.edu/). Update 7:30 PM: the network connection is working again, but as it turns out there also is a problem with one of the HVAC units in the server room. It is still unclear how the two problems are connected. Currently, facilities is working on the HVAC problem. To avoid overheating, the Slurm queue has been paused by the sys admins. Current jobs will continue to run, while pending jobs will need to wait until the situation improves. 

__CANCELLED: June 14th Shutdown Ahead of Genomics Electrical Maintenance__

Starting on Friday, June 14th at 8am and extending to Saturday, June 15th at 11pm UCR HPCC will be powering down the cluster ahead of a scheduled electrical shutdown of the UCR Genomics Building. To make the most of this downtime, HPCC will offline the cluster on the 14th in order to install routine software updates and perform other minor maintenance tasks. During the shutdown, most of our online services hosted from the UCR Genomics Building will be unavailable including, but is not limited to: SSH, Slurm, Rstudio, JupyterHub, OnDemand, and web file access. Please save your work on any of these services before the maintenance window. E-mail support may be temporarily interrupted, but should otherwise remain online. We recommend checking our [Slack channel](https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com/) for any minor status updates during the shutdown.

If you submit a Slurm or OnDemand job that extends into the maintenance window, you will receive an error containing "ReqNodeNotAvail". Your job will queue, but will not start, until maintenance is over. If you want your job to start sooner, cancel the job request, and resubmit your job with a shorter --time duration, such that your job will finish before the maintenance window begins.

We apologize for the disruption to your research and teaching workflows. Thanks for your understanding.

__7-May-2024: AC Unit Repairs, Slurm Paused__

After investigating a High Temperature warning on one of our AC units, campus Facilities determined a component in one of the AC units appears to be faulty and needs to be replaced. They are planning on receiving the replacement part the morning of the 8th, but in order to do the replacement both AC units will need to be taken offline. We've began putting nodes into a "draining" state in an attempt to bring the load on the cluster as low as possible to best manage heat in the server room. Existing jobs will continue to run, but newly scheduled jobs will be put in the queue until we can confirm that the repair has been completed and the AC units are online again. We know this is disruptive to your research and teaching, and we apologize for this development.

**Update 1:** Facilities was unable to complete the job in their time allotted for today, and will continue work tomorrow the morning (May 9th).

**Update 2:** While performing the repair, facilities identified a leak which needs to be patched before refilling the refrigerant, otherwise any refrigerant would immediately escape. The ETA for this repair, as given to us by facilities, is May 10th.

**Update 3:** Facilities has contacted us to say that they are finishing up the repairs and that we can begin to start loading the servers again. As such we've released ~50% of the nodes to begin running jobs again.

**Update 4:** Facilities has completed the repairs, and all nodes have been released.

__08-Mar-2024 AC Unit Refrigerant Leak, Queue Paused__

The UCR HPCC Slurm queue has been paused due to another AC malfunction in the server room. Earlier on Thursday (March 7th) afternoon, UCR Facilities was called in to check an AC alarm and determined that one of our AC units had low refrigerant. While attempting to recharge the AC refrigerant a leak occurred, forcing personnel to evacuate the room for their own safety. They intend to start the repair first thing on Friday (March 8th) morning. But because that AC unit is still not running at full capacity, cooling is limited. As such, the Slurm queue has been paused as a precaution to keep the room within a safe temperature. We understand that this will be disruptive to your work, and we apologize for this development.

Update 1: After speaking with the person performing the repair, they said that the repair could take all day. We will make further announcements as we receive updates.

Update 2: The repair has been completed and the Slurm queue has been released.

__22-Feb-2023: Upgrades of OS and GPFS__

Starting Thursday, February 22nd at 8:00am and lasting until Friday, February 23rd at 8:00pm, the cluster will be unavailable due 
to an upgrade of the Operating System as well as our central storage system. Any submitted jobs that overlap with the shutdown time will
be queued with the reason "ReqNodeNotAvail" and will need to be requeued with a shorter time or wait until the maintenance is over
at which point they will automatically start.

During the shutdown services will be unavailable including, but not limited to: SSH, RStudio, JupyterHub, OnDemand, and web-based file access.
If you need additional information or help, you can reach us at our [Slack](https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com/) or outside of the shutdown through
email (support@hpcc.ucr.edu).

**Update**: The shutdown had finished and the Slurm queue has been reopened.

__19-Jan-2024: AC Unit Repair Followup__

Due to followup maintenance required following the January 17th repairs, the
slurm queue will once again need to be haulted in order to manage heat output
in the server room. Maintenance should only take a few hours, after which the
queue will be released again.

**Update**: The repair has been completed. Nodes will be resumed and queue opened.

__17-Jan-2024: AC Unit repair__

The AC units in the HPCC server room are experiencing issues. To keep the
operating temperature within safe limits, the job queue has been halted. New
and pending jobs will stay queued, while currently running jobs will be allowed
to finish. We apologize for the inconvenience.

**Update**: The maintenance has completed, but a followup repair will be required in
order to return to 100% operation of the AC units.

__14 Aug, 2023: Login and GPFS storage issues__

* The login service on the primary headnode failed on Monday afternoon. A new headnode with updated software is now
  online, so users may access their files and do some light work. The GPFS cluster file system also exhibited some
  performance stalls. The Slurm scheduler has been paused until this issue subsides.

__4-Aug-2023: Upgrades of OS, GPFS, Slurm, Head Nodes and Power Distribution__

* HPCC staff will be performing maintenance work on Aug 4th to Aug 5th that will require a shut down of the HPCC cluster. 
  Objectives for this event include the following upgrades: GPFS, Slurm, OS upgrade to Rocky Linux 8.8, 
  electrical reconfiguration of PDUs, and various other maintenance tasks.

* Update Aug 6th: Due to underestimated workload on planned maintenance tasks, services are still offline.
  Basic functionality should be restored by the end of the day.

* Update Aug 7th: Maintenance is still ongoing. Currently, we are redeploying computer nodes and other services. 
  User login is restricted until the central data storage system has been re-mounted.

* Update Aug 8th: SSH login has been restored. Users can access their data and perform light work on the head nodes
  until access to a larger number of compute nodes has been restored. In addition, web-based file sharing and JupyterHub are available again.
  RStudio Server will be restored next. 

- Update Aug 9th: Slurm has been redployed and is operational. A larger number of computer nodes have been redeployed and are available 
  to users again.

- Final update Aug 11th: All remaining services are available again. The maintenance is complete. This includes remaining CPU and GPU nodes, etc. 
  We apologize for the extended time it took us to bring all services online again. Thank you for your understanding.

__17-18 Jul, 2023: Slurm halted__

* Facilities had to perform maintenance on the AC units due to the formation of condensation water by the AC units,
  possibly caused by hot summer days. During the maintenance Slurm jobs had to be halted to avoid overheating.
  Running jobs will be allowed to continue, provided that the server room does not get too hot.
